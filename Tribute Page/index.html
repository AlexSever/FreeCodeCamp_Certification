	            In July 17, 1971, Andy Whitfield was born in Amlwch, Wales. His parents Robert and Pat Whitfield then moved to Australia in 1999 with his sibling Laura.<br>
	            <br>
				Moved to Sydney, Australia after graduating the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England for Engineering.<br>
				<br>
				He started acting and modeling while working as an engineer and building inspector for a consulting agency.<br>
				<br>
				In 1999, Andy Whitfield married Terrica Smith-Whitfield and later to Vashti Whitfield. Andy is father of two wonderful children: Jesse Red Whitfield, born 2005 and Indigo sky Whitfield, born 2007.<br> 
				<br>
				He attended Screenwise Film & TV School for Actors, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.<br>
				<br>
				He has appeared in several Australian television series, such as Opening Up, All Saints, The Strip, Packed to the Rafters and McLeod's Daughters. He gained his first prominent role in the Australian supernatural film Gabriel.<br>
				<br>
				Still working his day job as an engineer, he sought a part as a Roman gladiator in ‘Spartacus: Blood and Sand’ and landed the lead role.<br>
				<br>
				Whitfield starred in the 2010 television series Spartacus: Blood and Sand, which is filmed in New Zealand. He plays the part of Spartacus, a soldier condemned to fight as a gladiator and who ultimately leads a rebellion against the Romans.<br>
				<br>
				Whitfield also appears in the upcoming Australian thriller The Clinic starring opposite Tabrett Bethell (of Legend of the Seeker fame), set for release in 2010, which was shot in Deniliquin.<br>
				<br>
				In March 2010, Whitfield was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, beginning treatment immediately in New Zealand. This delayed production of season two of Spartacus: Blood and Sand. Whitfield expects to return for a second season.<br>
				<br>
				In June 2010 it was announced that Whitfield completely finished his treatment and was given a clean bill of health. Regretfully he was expected to be back on the set of Spartacus: Blood and Sand by October but a setback caused delay in filming.<br>
				<br>
				September 2010, it was announced that Whitfield's cancer had returned and he would not be returning for the second season.<br>
				<br>
				Approximately a year later on September 11, 2011 and unforgettably and sadly a day that was in tribute around the world for America’s 9/11, our warrior Andy lost his battle with Lymphoma.<br>
				<br>
				"On a beautiful sunny Sydney spring morning, surrounded by his family, in the arms of his loving wife, our beautiful young warrior Andy Whitfield lost his 18 month battle with lymphoma cancer," Whitfield's wife Vashti said in a statement. "He passed peacefully surrounded by love. Thank you to all his fans whose love and support have help carry him to this point. He will be remembered as the inspiring, courageous and gentle man, father and husband he was."<br>
				<br>
				"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Andy Whitfield," Starz President and CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement Sunday night. "We were fortunate to have worked with Andy in `Spartacus' and came to know that the man who played a champion on-screen was also a champion in his own life."
